## Project Overview
In this project we will focus on building a dynamic UFO sightings webpage by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page. We will start by building a table to hold and neatly display the UFO data we want to work with. Then we'll add filters of that table which lets users refine their UFO search on multiple elements. The table and it's filters will be inserted into, and visually displayed by an HTML page. We'll use basic HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS to build and style the page. The end result will be a presentation of data that is both visually appealing and interactive.  

## Results and Webpage Functionality 
- **Initial webpage view:** When we first navigate to our dynamic site we find a table containing records of 111 UFO sightings. That's a lot of data for the user to sift through and digest all on their own. (see initial webpage below)
